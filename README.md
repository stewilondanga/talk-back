## Description

This is a proof of concept for a web based talk back interface. This poc relies on some experimental browser api's 

(web-speech-api) which is currently only supported by Chrome. Make sure you allow the browser to access your microphone. 

The speech-api stops listening after 60 seconds, this is a built-in limitation.

Try saying something to talk back, it's already listening! It may take some time for talk back to recognise or respond to 

your question, everything you say is sent to google servers to be analysed.

Some of the commands:

My name is {{your name}}
Are you on twitter?
Where are you from?
Can you beatbox?
